## Technical Overview
* Reactive Programming: Utilizes Combine for real-time data updates and UI bindings.
* Architecture: Implements the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern for clean code organization and maintainability.
* Networking: Fetches articles efficiently using URLSession and integrates the News API.
* Local Persistence: Uses Core Data for saving and retrieving articles, offering a smooth offline experience.
* User Interface: Built with UIKit and Nib files, ensuring a visually appealing, user-friendly design.
* Pagination: Implements smooth article loading as the user scrolls.
* Reachability: Monitors network connection status to provide a robust offline mode.

## Technical Enhancements:
#### Code Reusability with UIViewController Extension

To reduce redundancy and promote code reuse, an extension on UIViewController was implemented to add reusable methods used across multiple views.

#### Centralized Network Monitoring with NetworkBaseViewController
   
Centralized Network Monitoring: The app uses a NetworkBaseViewController class to encapsulate network monitoring logic. All other view controllers inherit this class to automatically monitor network status and handle changes efficiently.

##### How It Works?
1- Inheritability: Any view controller that needs network monitoring simply inherits NetworkBaseViewController.

2- Subclass Overrides: Override handleNetworkAvailable() and handleNoNetwork() in the subclass to customize behavior.

## Combine:
is used extensively in the app to manage reactive data updates and UI bindings,Below is an example of how Combine powers:
1- Fetching and Binding Articles:

![Bind UI with ViewmModel](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac91cbf6-d185-45be-a36f-9b0d57391c8e)

2- Search Optimization: 
Uses Combineâ€™s PassthroughSubject and debounce operators for real-time yet efficient search functionality. This ensures only meaningful search queries trigger network calls.
